Theories suggest the country was named after the god or vice-versa, but the meaning of 'Asshur' is unresolved. In Assyrian and Hebrew, the country and people's name derive from the god's name. The author believes the etymology of 'asshur' is found in the Maya language as 'AXUL', where 'A' is a possessive pronoun ('thy' or 'thine') and 'xul' means 'end' or 'termination,' and is also the sixth month of the Maya calendar.
