A woman of incisive intellect and unyielding spirit, the Narrator moves through a world often resistant to her pioneering vision. From her early days in India, nurtured by a kind childhood nurse, Sona, to her audacious pursuit of medicine, she has consistently defied convention. Labelled as "just a wumman" or "a girl" rather than a doctor by dismissive patients and institutional barriers, she nevertheless pressed on, her anger at such injustices fueling her resolve. She trained diligently, studying at the Rotunda and yearning for further refinement under masters like Pozzi in Paris, always aiming to become a "Missionary Professor" and achieve significant success, not for personal gain but to fund vital work like her own surgery.
Her life is a testament to fierce independence, as evidenced by her discussions with Mrs. G. Anderson about establishing an independent practice in Edinburgh, requiring no male assistance. A staunch advocate for women's rights and suffrage, she engages in heated debates, even converting stubborn men to her cause during surgical operations. Intellectually robust, she found kinship with figures like Elsie, with whom she debated Emerson and Matthew Arnold, exploring how "Culture" could regenerate society.
Yet, beneath this formidable exterior lies a deeply empathetic and introspective soul. She champions her patients, particularly vulnerable women, holding strong opinions against those who abandon their families. She observes the world with a "lonely delight," particularly drawn to "beautiful and vanishing things," and experiences profound love, once admitting her home is where a cherished recipient is. She is acutely self-aware, recognizing her own capacity for absurdity and folly, a "blunderer" like others, and scorns egoistic self-consolation, striving instead for fairness and consideration for her "neighbors."
As a mentor, she is a compassionate "old hen" to her "ducklings"—the younger women and companions she chaperones, sometimes reluctantly, through social engagements or even perilous natural landscapes in Cornwall. She commands implicit obedience from her companions, whether they are Indian villagers believing her a disenchanted great man come to revive their Lord Chaacmol, or her loyal crew navigating treacherous waters. She carries memories of helping the disadvantaged, from rescuing an infant girl to offering solace and warnings to strangers.
Her journeys are both physical and philosophical: from the academic halls of Edinburgh and Glasgow to the bustling streets of London, the cultural heart of Paris, and the challenging landscapes of Serbia where she aided in the return of Serbs alongside her beloved, albeit ailing, Aunt Elsie. Later, in Cornwall, she delights in simple beauty, shares wisdom with young lovers, and faces the sea's wild grandeur, always mindful of life's fragility and wonder. Despite a past brief paralysis that left her despairing of her future usefulness, she has cultivated a habit of mind that guards against self-partiality and promotes deep understanding. She is a character forged in resilience, defined by her commitment to truth, justice, and the quiet dignity of a life lived with purpose.
