Cousin Cæsar, a figure of intriguing contrasts, emerges from a childhood defined by a profound aversion to work yet boundless curiosity. As a boy, his playful mischief often led to reprimands from "big-sis" and "little-sis," tempered by "big-sis's" compassionate provision of her last loaf of bread, a moment sparked by Cæsar's fanciful expectation of bubbles transforming into food. This early display of imagination and opportunism set the stage for a life marked by restless ambition and self-preservation.
At thirteen, no longer subject to thrashings, he moved to Old Smith's farm, where his inherent cunning manifested in the infamous whisky-for-cider swap, a trick that cost him his position but cemented his knack for subtle manipulation. By twenty, having adopted the alias Cole Conway, he found himself in Paducah, Kentucky, navigating the dim-lit card rooms, a testament to his burgeoning taste for risk, even when met with loss.
A turning point arrived with the news of his uncle S. S. Simon's substantial Arkansas estate, a revelation from Brindle that repositioned Cæsar within a complex family legacy. He accompanied the critically ill Young Simon on a journey to the West Indies, privy to the burgeoning romance between Simon and Roxie Daymon, all while silently holding the secret of the estate's true financial entanglements and heirs. Simon's tragic death in Chicago ignited Cæsar's full ambition. Upon discovering Simon had willed his million-dollar estate to Roxie, and spurred by a recurring dream of the number "seventy-seven" connected to a law office on Strait Street, Cæsar swiftly engaged the services of the cunning Governor Morock, funding the initial legal challenge with Simon's own pocket money and later seeking aid from Cliff Carlo in Kentucky.
The tumultuous currents of the Civil War then drew Cæsar into its vortex. He proved a formidable soldier, brave as a lion on the battlefield, his sharp and selfish intellect thriving in General Price's Missouri campaign. Despite a near-fatal musket wound at Springfield, from which he was miraculously saved by Steve Brindle and a Cherokee Indian, Cæsar's core traits endured. The number "77," assigned to him in the army, became a superstitious preoccupation, a symbol of impending cuts and self-reproach. Yet, his ultimate loyalty lay with himself; once surrounded by wealth and power, he callously distanced himself from Steve Brindle, the very man who had saved his life and paved his way to fortune. His journey culminated as a camp lecturer, celebrating heroism, but his actions reveal a complex man: resourceful, adaptable, courageous in conflict, yet ultimately governed by an unwavering pursuit of personal gain, even at the cost of profound betrayal.
