"semantic_unit": "Surgery is recommended for squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes, involving the removal of the cancerous lesion and affected lymph nodes. If surgery is not feasible or too risky, immunotherapy with cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo) might be considered to shrink the tumor before surgery. The scope of surgery is determined by the number, location, and size of cancerous lymph nodes. Post-surgery, radiation therapy is often administered to lower the recurrence risk, and systemic therapy may be used in conjunction with radiation if lymph nodes were not fully removed or if cancer extended beyond the lymph node's outer layer.",

"semantic_unit": "For tumors that have spread to other areas of the body, surgery is the preferred treatment if possible, which includes removing the tumor and adjacent lymph nodes. Radiation therapy might follow surgery to eliminate any remaining cancer cells, especially if multiple lymph nodes were affected or if cancer had breached the lymph node's outer layer. If surgery is not an option, a multidisciplinary discussion among cancer doctors is advised to explore alternatives. If feasible, radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is recommended, with platinum-based chemotherapy being a preferred option alongside radiation. If radiation is unlikely to be fully effective or may harm healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is advised, with immunotherapy (immune checkpoint inhibitors) being a preferred choice if eligible. Clinical trials involving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy are also potential options.",
