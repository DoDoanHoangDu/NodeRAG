Short-term side effects of radiation therapy can include diarrhea, fatigue, frequent urination or pain during urination, and nausea, which typically decrease after treatment concludes. It's important to note that these side effects may not be immediately apparent and can emerge or intensify later in the treatment cycle or even after completion. Radiation therapy for anal cancer also carries the risk of long-term and potentially severe effects on fertility, sexual health, and the functioning of the bowel and bladder.",

For stages I, II, and III anal cancer, recommended chemotherapy regimens used in conjunction with radiation therapy include Mitomycin and capecitabine, Mitomycin and 5-FU, or 5-FU and cisplatin. During chemotherapy with these regimens, patients also receive radiation therapy five days a week.",

"semantic_unit": "The regimen of Mitomycin and capecitabine is commonly used. Capecitabine is taken orally twice daily, Monday through Friday (only on radiation days), for five and a half to six weeks, coinciding with radiation therapy. On the first day of capecitabine intake, a single intravenous dose of mitomycin is administered. A second dose of mitomycin is typically given at the beginning of the week. The regimen of Mitomycin and 5-FU is also recommended for use with radiation therapy. 5-FU is administered via continuous infusion over several days, allowing patients to be outside a treatment center during this period. Before chemotherapy commences, a thin, flexible tube known as a “port” is inserted into a vein in the upper chest, below the collarbone. Using a small wire and often x-ray guidance, this tube is directed to a large vein situated above the right side of the heart. Alternatively, some individuals may receive a temporary PICC line.",
