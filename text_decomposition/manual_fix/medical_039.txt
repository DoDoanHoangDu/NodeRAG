If biopsy results confirm spread to nearby lymph nodes, a computed tomography (CT) scan of those lymph nodes is recommended to assess the number, location, and size of cancerous nodes. More advanced imaging like PET/CT may be used to determine if cancer has spread beyond lymph nodes or to aid in treatment planning.",
