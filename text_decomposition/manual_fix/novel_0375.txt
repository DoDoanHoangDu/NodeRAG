"semantic_unit": "ANGELINE HALL writes to her sister MARY from GEORGETOWN on January 18th, '74. She expresses a strong desire to hear from MARY and mentions that \"Little A\" started a letter during his vacation and copied verses that MARY sent. The family is well: BABY is growing smart and handsome, ANGELO is fat and rosy (though requires care), and SAMIE is growing taller and has little time for play. MOTHER HALL is staying with ANGELINE for the winter and is helping with sewing. ANGELINE inquires about MARY's mother and MARY herself, and advises MARY to dress warmly. She also asks if MARY has any help for the winter and urges her to share all news, including whether SALINA has gone to music school. ANGELINE plans to write again soon and also needs to write to ELMINA in a few days. The BABY is fond of GRANPA's saw-man, and ANGELO is possessive of it.",

"semantic_unit": "ANGELINE writes to her sister MARY from GEORGETOWN on March 22nd, [1877 probably]. She mentions they are working on their grounds as the weather allows, anticipating it will be very pretty once completed, and their house is now very convenient. ANGELINE is planting a rose bush for her MOTHER and plans to plant one for GRANDMA HALL as well. SAMIE has improved significantly in the past year, becoming stout and tall. ANGELO is described as fat and keen. PERCY is a nice little boy who has learned most of his letters. ASAPH JR. is a diligent student for his age, striving for understanding. ANGELINE is generally well but must be careful due to a tendency to get malarial fever when she gets sick. She asks MARY to tell her MOTHER about the rose bush.",
