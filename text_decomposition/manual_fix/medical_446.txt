The most prevalent type of primary liver cancer in adults is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a rare subtype called fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHC) affecting younger individuals. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts, is the second most common type. Other less common types include sarcomas originating in the liver's blood vessel cells and mixed-type tumors comprising both HCC and cholangiocarcinoma. Information on gallbladder and bile duct tumors is available from NCCN.org and the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app. This guideline will focus on HCC and its treatment.",
